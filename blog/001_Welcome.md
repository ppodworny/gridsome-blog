# Welcome to my first blog

The following blog is build rather mindlessly using Gridsome.js. It's a server side generated static page generated from github repository. Netlifly bulds it automaticly every time the repo is changed and serves in a 100% static form. Post are stored as local Markdown files.

The main goal of this blog was to do something fun and productive with Vue.js. And while in the process I lerned absolutely nothing about this fascinating frintend framework I can safely say that Gridsome.js while currently far from production-ready state is an awesome piece of technology.

## More about Gridsome

Gridsome itself is based around Vue.js supplemented by GraphQL with schemas written using specific Gridsome plugins (no pripor GraphQL knowledge required.) It's a Vue eqivalent (copy?) of Gatsby.je itself using React.js.  It is a static website generator. During development we use node.js server with GrapQL, Vue.js and Webpack and once finalized eveything is digested into 100% static, extrely fast end product.
