# Problem with Netlifly

Netlifly seems to work diffrent from deployment server. Removing one blog entry destroyed whole site. It also duplicates some post entries. I tried deleting Netlifly page and setting it again to no avail. Hence this post. I hope pushing it will do something. But why would it??
